# group's name, and <VOname> must be case-sensitive! The field separator
# can be either _one_ space or _one_ tab.
#
# In case a user has a mapping for both user name and group, the specific

# The following parameter can be used to specify whether the CE uses pool

# to associate a job. If havePoolAccounts is "yes" (default), the VO is
# determined in the following way:
# 1) If the job is associated to a UserFQAN (determined by the urcollector):
#    => The VO is determined from the FQAN
# 2) Otherwise: The VO is determined from the unix login of the executing user
#    if the login can be interpreted as pool account (i.e. is of form
#    "<voname>NNN", "<voname>sgm" or "<voname>prd")
#    2a) if poolAccountPatternFile is also specified, then the VO patterns
#        are taken from there to determine the VO
#    2b) if poolAccountPatternFile is not specified a list of built in
#        standard patterns is used.
# 3) Otherwise: the VO is determined from the unix login or group if an
#    appropriate mapping in the localUserGroup2VOMap can be found.
# 4) Otherwise: the job will not be associated to any VO.
# For CEs that don't use pool accounts it is wise to deactivate step 2 by
