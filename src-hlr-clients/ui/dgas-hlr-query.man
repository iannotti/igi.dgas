.SH NAME
dgas-hlr-query \- DGAS client to query DGAS HLR server records database.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dgas-hlr-query -Q 
.I queryType 
.I SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dgas-hlr-query
This DGAS client can be used for advanced queries, such as to retrieve lists of records as well as aggregated information on users, resources, groups, roles and VOs.
Note that the authorization to access the accounting data will be checked by the HLR server, hence the use of the client requires a valid user X509 proxy certiÔ¨Åcate. Normal grid users can just retrieve information related to jobs submitted using their own x509 certificate. Only users mapped as HLR administrators can access all the usage records.
